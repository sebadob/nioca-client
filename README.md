# nioca-client

This is the client for the [Nioca](https://github.com/sebadob/nioca) project.  
It contains a CLI tool and libraries for Axum and Actix Server TLS configs.

This client is basically working already with Nioca v0.4, but needs some more testing before the first public release.

The Readme will be written with the first public release.
